# Movie Search: Project 1

## About the project
As a group we agreed that everybody enjoys a good movie, so we decided to develop a  movie search website that will help to choose new movies to watch.

A user will be able to input a movie title and see movies related to their search terms.
The user will then be able to see a plot synopsis, ratings and a link to a trailer to see if they want to watch the movie.

We used the Open Movie Database API and YouTube APIs for the main search and trailer functionalities of the site.

## User Story

```
AS A movie watcher
I WANT to search for new movies to watch
SO THAT I can find a new movie
```

## Functionality

```
GIVEN a movie search dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a movie
THEN I am presented with movies related to my search terms
WHEN I view the search results
THEN I am presented with a movie poster, the title of the movie, the year it was made, and a short plot synopsis
WHEN I click the title I want
THEN I am directed to a new page with more movie details, such as title, year, director, cast, IMDB rating, a full plot synopsis, and a trailer for the movie
WHEN I return to the main search page
THEN I am presented with my recently viewed movies in a search history bar
WHEN I click on a movie in the search history
THEN I am again presented with the page with the movie details and the trailer.
```
## Challenges
Being the first group project that all of us have participated in it came with some challenges. The first one we encounter was merge conflicts. We spent a lot of time fixing merge conflicts and probably have more than a few commits that were simply to fix our merging.

The second was scheduling. Not all of us work on the same schedules so it was hard to find times when all of us could code together. So there were a few times where we would code alone and then meet up to see what others had done. Then of course the merge conflicts after that haha.

Overall we are very proud of how the site turned out. There is still some room for improvement but that could be said about any website and another challenge is knowing when to stop.
