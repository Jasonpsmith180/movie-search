# Movie Search: Project 1

## The reason for this website.
As a group we agreed that everybody enjoys a good movie, so we decided to develop a website
commited to help you search for the movie you would like to watch.

A user will be able to input a movie title/actor/genre etc and see movies related to their search terms.
The user will then be able to see a plot synopsis, ratings and a link to a trailer to see if they want to watch the movie.

We will use the Open Movie Database API and YouTube APIs for the main search and trailer functionalities of the site.
